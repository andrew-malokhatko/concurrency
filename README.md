# Concurrency
Solution to the most common concurrent problems

# Motivation
I have recently learned about concurrency and mechanisms
taht are used to enforce it correctly. But by now I have only touched on theory
and not practice (which is no wonder as my personal projects are usually
no that complex to require advanced synchronization techniques).
This repo is so to say a playground where i aim to solve some basic or popular
concurrennt problems. I have also decided to use both C and C++
where C is used to understand the base concept and C++
serves as an improved version of a C program.

# Usage
CMake....
